    - BAD: In the vocabulary table it did not show the Japanese characters, the cells are just blank.
    - BAD: The beginning sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues the LM provided, we should not provide the polite form of verbs, because the student needs to figure that out. 
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Bad example response:
    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and work on translating it into Japanese.
    Vocabulary Table

    | Japanese | Romanji | English                  |
    |          | kuma    | bear                     |
    |          | tobira  | door                     |
    |          | mottai  | garbage                  |
    |          | nusunda | leave (something) behind |
    |          | suteru  | throw away (garbage)     |

    Possible Sentence Structure
    Verb: (Did you) + Verb (leave/throw away) + Object (garbage) + Particle + Location (outside)?
    Verb: (Bears) + Verb (are) + Location (at the door)?
    Clues
    The verb (to be) in Japanese is not always necessary.
    Think about how to express "at the door" in Japanese.
    For the second part of the sentence, consider using a polite form of the verb, as it's a question.
    Now, try to put the pieces together and see what you come up with!

    - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediately
    - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence structure
    - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tenses or conjugations

        Sentence structure:
        [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]

        Considerations: 
        - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
        - The first part is stating a location where something exists
        - The second part is asking about a past action

        Possible next steps:
        - attempt an answer
        - ask clues about location marking
        - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
        - ask clues about question formation
        - ask clues about verb conjugation
