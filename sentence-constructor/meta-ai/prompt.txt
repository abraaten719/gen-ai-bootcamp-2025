Student Input: Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?

Bad example response:
Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and work on translating it into Japanese.
Vocabulary Table
Japanese	Romanji	English
kuma	bear
tobira	door
mottai	garbage
nusunda	leave (something) behind
suteru	throw away (garbage)
Possible Sentence Structure
Verb: (Did you) + Verb (leave/throw away) + Object (garbage) + Particle + Location (outside)?
Verb: (Bears) + Verb (are) + Location (at the door)?
Clues
The verb (to be) in Japanese is not always necessary.
Think about how to express "at the door" in Japanese.
For the second part of the sentence, consider using a polite form of the verb, as it's a question.
Now, try to put the pieces together and see what you come up with!
